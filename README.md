This Sprint Review & Retrospective demonstrates how I applied core Agile/Scrum practices—planning, collaborative execution, empirical inspection, and iterative improvement. It captures how my team aligned on goals, delivered an increment, and used feedback loops to refine both the product and our process.

**Program Reflection**
**1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories help?**

I interpret user needs by gathering outcomes (“what problem are we solving?”) and constraints (“what must be true?”), then translating them into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Stories keep the focus on user value (“As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]”) and acceptance criteria define “done” in testable terms. This enables traceability from need → requirement → implementation → test. In practice, I refine stories collaboratively, size them, prioritize by value/risk, and validate with working software and user feedback.

**2) How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes will I carry forward?**

My approach is iterative and incremental:

Backlog refinement to ensure stories are small, valuable, and testable.

Sprint planning to set a realistic goal aligned with priority.

Daily standups to surface blockers early and adjust.

Definition of Done and acceptance tests to protect quality.

Sprint Review for stakeholder feedback and Retrospective to improve the team system.
Going forward, I’ll keep using lightweight documentation, automated checks where feasible, and short feedback loops that reduce risk and rework.

**3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

It means being transparent, reliable, and user-value focused. I communicate early about risks, offer help across roles when possible, and respect the team’s working agreements. I treat feedback as a gift, separate ideas from individuals, and use retrospectives to improve the system, not just the people. Ultimately, a good teammate helps the team deliver quality increments predictably and sustainably.
